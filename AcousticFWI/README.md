# ACOUSTIC ADJOINT-STATE RIGOR CHECK WORFLOWLAST UPDATE : February 22nd 2016 FOrward modelling worksCheck this file to know what part is working properly.The notebook contains the symbolic expression for the modelling and inversion of acoustic 2D data. Every loop is written explicitly so the code takes a while to run. The modelling operator are written in symbolic python and the notebook contains text sections explaining the workflow for rigorousness checking of an inversion based implementation.# IntroAll operator have a proper symbolic expression and solvers are setup. Waiting for testing.The Grid size and time step are based on the CFL condition for a Ricker wavelet with peak frequency f0 (expression commented in the notebook) and the maximum and minimum velocity.# ModellingForward/Adjoint modelling in testForward modelling behaves properly, shot record has the correct shape. Adjoint test in progress# InversionWritten, will be updated as the modelling part is tested. It is very low to run as it needs a lot of  PDE solves (~10)
